<b>Problem statement</b>: Social media floods user with distracting noise alongside valuable content. Users need a simple way to filter out what kills focus - and keep only what fuels growth.

<br>
<b>Proposed solution</b>: A browser extension that filters out distracting or irrelevant post from social media feeds, helping users stay focused, reduce digital noise and engage only with content that matters to them.

The tool work 100% client side so user privacy is protected.
It empowers the user- it does not manipulate the feed for profit(unlike social media algorithem)</b>

## Project Status & Practice Progress

To strengthen the core logic for our Focus-Filter browser extension, Iâ€™m actively practicing essential JavaScript and DOM manipulation concepts.

**Practice includes:**
- **DOM selectors:** `querySelector`, `querySelectorAll`, `getElementById`, `getElementsByClassName`, `getElementsByTagName`
- **Content manipulation:** `innerText`, `textContent`, `innerHTML`
- **Hands-on practice files:** `practiceJavaScript.js`, `practiceHTML1.html`, `practiceHTML2.html`

This practical learning ensures our final extension is technically sound and can effectively block or hide distracting elements on web pages.
