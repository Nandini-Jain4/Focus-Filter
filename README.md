<b>Problem statement</b>: Social media floods user with distracting noise alongside valuable content. Users need a simple way to filter out what kills focus - and keep only what fuels growth.

<br>
<b>Proposed solution</b>: A browser extension that filters out distracting or irrelevant post from social media feeds, helping users stay focused, reduce digital noise and engage only with content that matters to them.

The tool work 100% client side so user privacy is protected.
It empowers the user- it does not manipulate the feed for profit(unlike social media algorithem)</b>

<b>Thank you</b>

<b>Project Status & Practice Progress</b>
Current Focus : Sharpening core JavaScript skills — especially DOM manipulation and event handling — to build the filtering logic for the Focus-Filter browser extension.

<b>Covered So Far</b>
DOM Selectors: querySelector, getElementById, etc.
Style & Attributes: .style, .cssText, .className, .classList, .setAttribute()
Events: addEventListener(), removeEventListener(), event phases, default actions
Other Topics: window.open(), window.close(), monitorEvents(), unmonitorEvents()

<b>Why This Matters</b>
These hands-on practices ensure our extension can detect, modify, and filter web page elements in real time, helping users block distracting or irrelevant content on platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and Facebook.

<b>Practice Files Updated</b>
practiceJavaScript(DOM).js
practiceJavaScript(BrowserEvents).js
practiceHTML3.html
practiceHTML4.html

PPT added for reference of my Project.
Continuous sharpening of these fundamentals ensures my final hackathon solution is solid, user-focused, and practical!
