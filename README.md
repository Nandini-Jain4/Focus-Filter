<b>Theme</b>: Open Innovation
<br>
<b>Problem statement</b>: Social media floods user with distracting noise alongside valuable content. Users need a simple way to filter out what kills focus - and keep only what fuels growth.
<br>
<b>Proposed solution</b>: A browser extension that filters out distracting or irrelevant post from social media feeds, helping users stay focused, reduce digital noise and engage only with content that matters to them.
<br>
<b>
The tool work 100% client side so user privacy is protected.
It empowers the user- it does not manipulate the feed for profit(unlike social media algorithem)</b>
<br>
<b>Thank you</b>
