<br>
<b>Problem statement</b>: Social media floods user with distracting noise alongside valuable content. Users need a simple way to filter out what kills focus - and keep only what fuels growth.

<br>
<b>Proposed solution</b>: A browser extension that filters out distracting or irrelevant post from social media feeds, helping users stay focused, reduce digital noise and engage only with content that matters to them.

The tool work 100% client side so user privacy is protected.
It empowers the user- it does not manipulate the feed for profit(unlike social media algorithem)</b>

## Project Status & Practice Progress

Sharpened core **JavaScript** skills — especially **DOM manipulation** and **event handling** — to build the filtering logic for the **Focus-Filter** browser extension.

---

## Covered So Far
- **DOM Selectors:** `querySelector`, `getElementById`, etc.
- **Style & Attributes:** `.style`, `.cssText`, `.className`, `.classList`, `.setAttribute()`
- **Events:** `addEventListener()`, `removeEventListener()`, event phases, default actions
- **Other Topics:** `window.open()`, `window.close()`, `monitorEvents()`, `unmonitorEvents()`
- ✅ **Focus-Filter Demo:** Blurs distracting posts on a mock social media feed
- Learned and practiced JSON

## Focus-Filter Demo Files
- `Filter.html`
- `FilterLogic.js`
  
## JSON Practice Files
- `jsonChaiWithCode.js`
- `jsonCodeWithHarry.json`
- `jsonCodeWithHarry.json` <b>This file contains a error</b>,
                          According to StackOverFlow : "We cannot comment in JSON because JSON is data-only. If you include a comment, then it must be data too."
                          But then also I tried comment some lines of code just like in JavaScript for my understanding.
                          Sorry for this confusion created beacuse of comments (//).

## Why This Matters
These hands-on practices ensure the extension can **detect, modify, and filter** web page elements in real time — helping users block distracting or irrelevant content(varies person to person) on platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and Facebook.

**PPT** added for project reference — ready for review by **1 PM, 8 July 2025**.

**Continuous learning and practical testing** ensure the final hackathon solution is **solid, user-focused, and effective!**
